# **Course Description**

This repository teaches you the Pytorch foundation through examples.

The course begins to explain you what is a neural network. If you are interested
in getting Pytorch knowledge and understand the basics that you see in every
Pytorch implementation, my recommendation is start for Chapter 4.
Understanding this chapter in details is very important because it helps you
 to develop any neural network architecture using Pytorch.

After understand in deep the Chapter 4, the courses teaches how you can use Pytorch
to develop:
- convolutional neural network to image classification
- transfer learning
- recurrent neural network for text classification
- deploying Pytorch Models

All course can be downloaded at:

 If you don't have a GPU graphic card the recommendation is to create an account
 in one of these cloud services:
- AWS
- GCP
- FloydHub

Have fun and enjoy this course.
